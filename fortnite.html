Constant practice is the best way to get better at something, but these 20 Fortnite pro tips should help get you on the road to your first Victory Royale.
Pro tips for winning in Fortnite
Seasoned a little and looking for an edge to take you closer to the top 10 or even toward your first victory? These advanced tips will go a long way toward your improvement.
Pick your fights carefully
Anyone watching YouTube footage or a live stream of serious Fortnite players might see them engaging with any enemy they can find and they often go looking for that trouble. We're here to tell you that this is counter productive to a winning strategy.
One of the biggest things you'll need to learn right away is that it's OK to not engage or to run away after an encounter has gone sour. Remember, your objective is to survive, not rack up a ridiculous kill/death ratio as if you're playing Call of Duty.
Do NOT get caught in the storm
The other first rule of Fortnite: do not mess with The Storm. It's a beast of a thing that can't be controlled. It is your biggest enemy, even scarier than the 99 others standing between you and Victory Royal.
This is especially true as you get closer to the top 10, as the safe zone gets smaller and the storm hits much harder. Run away from it, always. If you can't make it on foot, try looking for a golf cart. This is the only auto-mobile in the game and it'll get you from point A to point B much faster than your legs will.
Shoot first, loot later
As you're out there looking for the items and tools to help you to victory, don't forget that those tools won't do you any good if you're dead. When you're coming to a new area, take time to scope it out and see if anyone is lingering around before you start putting your head inside loot crates.
Don't be one dimensional
You know how you're never supposed to bring a knife to a gunfight? Well, the same thing is sort of true in Fortnite: you never want to go into battle without a balanced load out that will help you adapt to changing conditions. Just as you wouldn't want to use a sniper in close quarters, you wouldn't want a shotgun up against someone who can land accurate shots from hundreds of meters out.
An example of a well-balanced load out is a shotgun, an assault rifle, and a sniper rifle, with the other 2 slots of your inventory taking up healing items. You don't always have to go this route (in fact, as you play more you'll find that this is harder to achieve than you think), but the idea is to be able to protect yourself the most you can from any distance.
Use your surroundings to track enemy players
If you picked up some tracking skills in the Boy or Girl Scouts, it's time to put them to use here. Due to the nature of how people build in Fortnite, you will come across structures abandoned in the world for one reason or another. These structures may be one ramp or a mile-high fortress, but either way, you'll want to take note of where they are and how certain elements are positioned.
For instance, if you see a ramp leading up a mountain, you can probably bet (or you should at least assume) that enemies have taken a position up there. Whether you use that information to find a fight or take a flight, well, that's up to you.
High ground is key
In any shooter, high ground tends to be the most favourable position against your enemies because you can scout and see more, which also means you can shoot at more areas that they try to hide in.
That concept holds true for Fortnite, but the wrinkle nozzle that the building system brings in makes it even more crucial to your success. Being able to build a multi-tiered structure over your opponent's head while they're struggling to dodge your shots can make them panic, and your ability to dictate the pace of the engagement by making them build up to you almost always tips the scales in your favour.
You can get to hard-to-reach places by jumping on tires
If you see a stack of tires in the game, jump on them. Not only is it extremely fun, but it lets you jump much higher than the game's already-ridiculous height cap allows. This is especially useful if you want to get on top of a building but don't have (or want to use) materials to get up there.
Wood is your most important material
